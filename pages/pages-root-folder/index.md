Hi, I am a third-year PhD student in the Networked Embedded Systems Group of the <a href="https://www.iti.tugraz.at">Institute of Technical Informatics</a> at Graz University of Technology (TU Graz) under the supervision of <a href="https://www.tugraz.at/institute/iti/institut/team/prof-kay-roemer/"> Kay Römer</a>. 
Furthermore, I am a member of the TU Graz Excellence Project <a href="https://www.tugraz.at/projekte/dependablethings/home/"> "Dependable Internet of Things" </a>.
I received the B.Sc. and Dipl.-Ing. degrees in Electrical Engineering from TU Graz in 2012 and 2014, respectively.
Currently I am a visiting researcher in the <a href="https://lab11.eecs.berkeley.edu/index.html">Lab11</a> Embedded Systems Research Group at the UC Berkeley working with <a href="https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~prabal/"> Prabal Dutta </a>.

My research aims to provide wireless, constrained, and embedded devices with highly-precise and reliable information about their location and surrounding environment at minimal system complexity, size, and costs.
<!--reliable and efficient wireless communication and localization for future Internet-of-Things applications. -->
Towards this goal I am exploiting the high bandwidth and time resolution of wireless technologies such as ultra-wideband (UWB). 
The latter enabled my recent work on environment-dependent adaptation of physical layer parameters to provide highly robust UWB links <a href="../pubs/grosswindhager2018adaptation.pdf" target="_blank">[WoWMoM '18]</a> and the first low-cost UWB-based single anchor
localization system to minimize costs and setup time of RF-based localization systems <a href="../pubs/grosswindhager2018salma.pdf" target="_blank">[Sensys '18]</a>. 
Furthermore, I have introduced a concept to acquire distance information to an arbitrary number of devices (quasi-)simultaneously <a href="../pubs/grosswindhager2018concurrent.pdf" target="_blank">[ICDCS '18]</a>. 

Besides my academic research I gained more than six years of industrial experience in biomedical engineering working on brain-computer interfaces (g.tec medical engineering) and automotive engineering in the context of automated driving functions (Virtual Vehicle Research Center, Magna Steyr). Furthermore, I spent a significant portion of my career abroad, in the United States (UC Berkeley, Advanced Machine and Engineering), Japan (Asahikawa Medical University), and The Netherlands (TU Delft) as a researcher, engineer, and student.
